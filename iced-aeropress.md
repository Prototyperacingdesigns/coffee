## Iced AeroPress

#### You need

- An AeroPress
- A filter (I use the [Kaffeologie S-Filter](http://kaffeologie.com/shop/s-filter-for-aeropress-coffee-makers))
- 25 grams of coffee beans
- 160 ml water, close to boiling point
- Lots of ice (you'll need quite a few as the hot coffee is pressed directly on the ice, melting a lot of it)

#### Instructions

1. Invert the AeroPress
2. Add coffee grounds
3. Pour water into AeroPress
4. Give it a good stir
5. Steep for 2 minutes, giving it another good stir after about a minute
6. Invert AeroPress
7. Press directly on a glass filled with ice cubes
