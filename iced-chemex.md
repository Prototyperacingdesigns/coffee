## Iced Chemex

The beauty of this version is that there'll be plenty of ice left in the Chemex after brewing, so it's ready to serve without any further ice right away.

It's wonderfully light and perfect for a hot sommer day.

### You need

* a 6 or 8 cup Chemex
* 400 grams of ice cubes
* 400 grams of boiled water (96 degrees)
* 50 grams of coffee beans

### Instructions

* Grind the beans (duh!), a normal filter grind
* Pile the ice cubes in the Chemex
* Brew the coffee just like you'd normally do for a Chemex brew
